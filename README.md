## 🛠 Strategic Tech Stack & Integrations
We build for reliability, precision, and data sovereignty:
* **Core Engine:** n8n (Advanced Logic & API Orchestration)
* **Lead Capture:** Custom ROI Calculator with **SheetDB + Google Sheets** integration for real-time lead management.
* **Automation:** Zapier (Seamless Cloud Integration for 6,000+ apps).
* **Intelligence:** GPT-4o & Claude 3.5 Sonnet for qualifying and routing logic.

## 📈 Key Built-in Features
* **Lead Intelligence ROI Engine:** A psychological anchor that calculates "Capital Leakage" and captures B2B leads (Name, Business, Email).
* **Systems Research (PoC):** Technical blueprints for Lead Intelligence, Content Multiplication, and Operational Triage.
* **Automatic Lead Sync:** Integrated with Google Sheets to ensure 24/7 data capture even when local n8n instances are offline.

## 🏗 System Design Strategy
Our approach follows the **LogicPrompt Validation Method**:
1. **Identify Leakage:** Pinpoint manual task bottlenecks.
2. **Architecture Mapping:** Design modular, event-driven workflows.
3. **Stress Testing:** Validate failure handling and API timeout logic.
4. **Deployment:** Production-ready systems that scale with 10x volume.
